# Deep-Learning-for-Age-Estimation-A-CNN-Model-in-TensorFlow
This project tackles a key challenge for the Good Seed supermarket chain: complying with alcohol sales regulations by preventing sales to underage customers. The goal is to build and evaluate a computer vision model that can estimate a person's age from a photograph, serving as a support tool for staff at the point of sale.
